 MY TO-DO APP

DESCRIPTION
The app is a  task management tool that allows you to easily create, organize, and prioritize your daily and weekly tasks. With this app, you can set up an account and start creating your to-do list in just a few clicks. Keep track of all your chores, schedule them according to their expected date and time, and get notified when they are due using our reminder feature. 

Our reminder feature sends you an email with a link to the task, allowing you to easily access and complete it. You can also specify when you want to be reminded, ensuring that you never miss a task. If a task is incomplete but its scheduled time has passed, our app will automatically mark it as skipped.
